# Autonomous-System-EKF-with-LIDAR
Development of Extended Kalman Filter with Lidar laser for MBOT robot localization using Robot Operating System (ROS), implemetned in python. The ICP algorithm was modified from previous implementation to deal with different size of point clouds. Also a Ransac algorith was developed to discard outliers in those point clouds
